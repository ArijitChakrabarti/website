            "content": "1. Overview . Can deep learning help to detect blindness? . This blogpost describes the pipeline of the project that develops a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the severity of the diabetic retinopathy based on the patient&#39;s retina photograph. The project was completed within the scope of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nano-degree program and the Kaggle competition hosted by the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS). . The blogpost provides a project walkthrough covering the most important modeling steps. . data exploration and image preprocessing to normalize images from different clinics | using transfer learning to pre-train CNN on a large data set and fine-tune the model on target domain | implementing techniques such as learnung rate scheduler, test-time augmentation and others to improve the performance | . The modeling is done in PyTorch. All Jupyter notebooks and a PDF report are available on Github. . 2. Motivation . Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss. The World Health Organization reports that more than 300 million people worldwide have diabetes (Wong et al 2016). According to a recent study from International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalence of DR among the individuals with diabetes for the period from 2015 to 2019 was at more than 25% (Thomas et al 2019). The disease prevalence has been rising rapidly in developing countries. . Early detection and treatment are crucial steps towards preventing DR. The screening procedure requires a trained clinical expert to examine the fundus photographs of the patient&#39;s retina. This creates delays in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. This is especially relevant for developing countries, which often lack qualified medical stuff to perform the diagnosis. Automated detection of DR can speed up the efficiency and coverage of the screening programs. . 3. Data preparation . Data exploration and preprocessing are very important steps that are frequently underestimated. Reagrdless of the application domain, the quality of the input data can have a strong impact on the resulting performance of the developed machine learning models. Therefore, it is crucial to take some time to look at the data and think about possible issues that should be addressed before moving on to the modeling stage. . Data exploration . The data set is provided by APTOS and is available for the download at the competition&#39;s website. The data set includes 3,662 labeled retina images of clinical patients and a test set with 1,928 images with unknown labels. . The images are taken using a fundus photography technique and labeled by a clinical expert. The integer labels indicate the severity of DR on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no disease and 5 is the proliferative stage of DR. . First, let us import the data and look at the class ditribution. . #collapse-hide ############ LIBRARIES import numpy as np import pandas as pd import torch import torchvision from torchvision import transforms, datasets from torch.utils.data import Dataset from PIL import Image, ImageFile ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True import cv2 from tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm import random import time import sys import os import math import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns ########## SETTINGS pd.set_option(&#39;display.max_columns&#39;, None) %matplotlib inline import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(&#39;ignore&#39;) ############ CHECK DIMENSIONS # import data train = pd.read_csv(&#39;../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train.csv&#39;) test = pd.read_csv(&#39;../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/sample_submission.csv&#39;) # check shape print(train.shape, test.shape) print(&#39;-&#39; * 15) print(train[&#39;diagnosis&#39;].value_counts(normalize = True)) ############ CLASS DISTRIBUTION # plot fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5)) plt.hist(train[&#39;diagnosis&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;Class Distribution&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Number of examples&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Diagnosis&#39;) . . The data set is imbalanced. 49% of the images are healthy patients. The remaining 51 % are pictures with different stages of DR. The least common class is 3 (severe stage) with only 5% of the total examples. . The data is collected from multiple clinics in India using a variety of different camera models, which creates discrepancies in the image resolution, aspect ratio and other parameters. This is demonstrated in the fogire below, where we plot the histograms of image width, height and aspect ratio. A high variety in the image parameters requires to be accounted for during the data prepossessing. . #collapse-show ############ IMAGE SIZES # placeholder image_stats = [] # import loop for index, observation in tqdm(train.iterrows(), total = len(train)): # import image img = cv2.imread(&#39;../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train_images/{}.png&#39;.format(observation[&#39;id_code&#39;])) # compute stats height, width, channels = img.shape ratio = width / height # save image_stats.append(np.array((observation[&#39;diagnosis&#39;], height, width, channels, ratio))) # construct DF image_stats = pd.DataFrame(image_stats) image_stats.columns = [&#39;diagnosis&#39;, &#39;height&#39;, &#39;width&#39;, &#39;channels&#39;, &#39;ratio&#39;] ############ IMAGE SIZE DISTRIBUTION fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5)) # width plt.subplot(1, 3, 1) plt.hist(image_stats[&#39;width&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;(a) Image Width&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Number of examples&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Width&#39;) # height plt.subplot(1, 3, 2) plt.hist(image_stats[&#39;height&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;(b) Image Height&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Number of examples&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Height&#39;) # ratio plt.subplot(1, 3, 3) plt.hist(image_stats[&#39;ratio&#39;]) plt.title(&#39;(c) Aspect Ratio&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Number of examples&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Ratio&#39;) . . #collapse-hide ############ DATASET # image preprocessing function def prepare_image(path, image_size = 256): # import image = cv2.imread(path) image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # resize image = cv2.resize(image, (int(image_size), int(image_size))) # convert to tensor image = torch.tensor(image) image = image.permute(2, 1, 0) return image # dataset class: class EyeData(Dataset): # initialize def __init__(self, data, directory, transform = None): self.data = data self.directory = directory self.transform = transform # length def __len__(self): return len(self.data) # get items def __getitem__(self, idx): img_name = os.path.join(self.directory, self.data.loc[idx, &#39;id_code&#39;] + &#39;.png&#39;) image = prepare_image(img_name) image = self.transform(image) label = torch.tensor(self.data.loc[idx, &#39;diagnosis&#39;]) return {&#39;image&#39;: image, &#39;label&#39;: label} ############ EXAMINE SAMPLE BATCH # transformations sample_trans = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToPILImage(), transforms.ToTensor(), ]) # dataset sample = EyeData(data = train, directory = &#39;../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train_images&#39;, transform = sample_trans) # data loader sample_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset = sample, batch_size = 10, shuffle = False, num_workers = 4) # display images for batch_i, data in enumerate(sample_loader): # extract data inputs = data[&#39;image&#39;] labels = data[&#39;label&#39;].view(-1, 1) # create plot fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15, 7)) for i in range(len(labels)): ax = fig.add_subplot(2, len(labels)/2, i + 1, xticks = [], yticks = []) plt.imshow(inputs[i].numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0)) ax.set_title(labels.numpy()[i]) break . . Now, let us take a look at the actual images. The code below creates the EyeData dataset class to import the images using opencv library. We also create a DataLoader object to load sample images and visualize the first batch. . . The illustration further emphasizes the difference between the retina photographs in terms of aspect ratio, lighting conditions and camera quality. In practice, the severity of DR is diagnosed by the presence of different visual cues on the retina photographs. This includes signs like abnormal blood vessels, hard exudates and so-called &quot;cotton wool&quot; spots. Comparing the sample images, we can see the presence of exudates and &quot;cotton wool&quot; spots on some of the retina photographs of sick patients. . Image preprocessing . Visual inspection of retina images suggests that images taken from cameras with different aspect ratios result in some images having large black areas around the eye. The black areas do not contain information relevant for prediction and can be cropped. However, we see that the size of black areas varies from one image to another. To address this, we develop a cropping function that converts the image to grayscale and marks black areas based on the pixel intensity. Next, we find a mask of the image by selecting rows and columns in which all pixels exceed the intensity threshold. This helps to remove vertical or horizontal rectangles filled with black similar to the ones observed in the upper-right image in Figure 4. After removing the black stripes, we resize the images to the same height and width. . Another issue is the eye shape. Depending on the image parameters, some eyes appear to have a circular form, whereas others look like ovals. As the size and shape of items located in the retina determine the disease severity, it is crucial to standardize the eye shape as well. To do so, we develop another cropping function that makes a circular crop of a particular radius around the center of the image. . Finally, we correct for the lightning and brightness discrepancies by smoothing the images using a Gaussian filter. . The snippet below provides the updated prepare_image() function that incorporates the discussed preprocessing steps. . #collapse-show ############ PREPROCESSING FUNCTIONS ##### image preprocessing function def prepare_image(path, sigmaX = 10, do_random_crop = False): # import image image = cv2.imread(path) image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # perform smart crops image = crop_black(image, tol = 7) if do_random_crop == True: image = random_crop(image, size = (0.9, 1)) # resize and color image = cv2.resize(image, (int(image_size), int(image_size))) image = cv2.addWeighted(image, 4, cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (0, 0), sigmaX), -4, 128) # circular crop image = circle_crop(image, sigmaX = sigmaX) # convert to tensor image = torch.tensor(image) image = image.permute(2, 1, 0) return image ##### automatic crop of black areas def crop_black(img, tol = 7): if img.ndim == 2: mask = img &gt; tol return img[np.ix_(mask.any(1),mask.any(0))] elif img.ndim == 3: gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY) mask = gray_img &gt; tol check_shape = img[:,:,0][np.ix_(mask.any(1),mask.any(0))].shape[0] if (check_shape == 0): return img else: img1 = img[:,:,0][np.ix_(mask.any(1),mask.any(0))] img2 = img[:,:,1][np.ix_(mask.any(1),mask.any(0))] img3 = img[:,:,2][np.ix_(mask.any(1),mask.any(0))] img = np.stack([img1, img2, img3], axis = -1) return img ##### circular crop around image center def circle_crop(img, sigmaX = 10): height, width, depth = img.shape largest_side = np.max((height, width)) img = cv2.resize(img, (largest_side, largest_side)) height, width, depth = img.shape x = int(width / 2) y = int(height / 2) r = np.amin((x,y)) circle_img = np.zeros((height, width), np.uint8) cv2.circle(circle_img, (x,y), int(r), 1, thickness = -1) img = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask = circle_img) return img ##### random crop def random_crop(img, size = (0.9, 1)): height, width, depth = img.shape cut = 1 - random.uniform(size[0], size[1]) i = random.randint(0, int(cut * height)) j = random.randint(0, int(cut * width)) h = i + int((1 - cut) * height) w = j + int((1 - cut) * width) img = img[i:h, j:w, :] return img . . Next, we define a new EyeData class that uses the new processing functions and visualize a batch of sample images after corrections. . #collapse-show ############ DATASET # dataset class: class EyeData(Dataset): # initialize def __init__(self, data, directory, transform = None): self.data = data self.directory = directory self.transform = transform # length def __len__(self): return len(self.data) # get items def __getitem__(self, idx): img_name = os.path.join(self.directory, self.data.loc[idx, &#39;id_code&#39;] + &#39;.png&#39;) image = prepare_image(img_name) image = self.transform(image) label = torch.tensor(self.data.loc[idx, &#39;diagnosis&#39;]) return {&#39;image&#39;: image, &#39;label&#39;: label} ############ EXAMINE SAMPLE BATCH image_size = 256 # transformations sample_trans = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToPILImage(), transforms.ToTensor(), ]) # dataset sample = EyeData(data = train, directory = &#39;../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train_images&#39;, transform = sample_trans) # data loader sample_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset = sample, batch_size = 10, shuffle = False, num_workers = 4) # display images for batch_i, data in enumerate(sample_loader): # extract data inputs = data[&#39;image&#39;] labels = data[&#39;label&#39;].view(-1, 1) # create plot fig = plt.figure(figsize = (15, 7)) for i in range(len(labels)): ax = fig.add_subplot(2, len(labels)/2, i + 1, xticks = [], yticks = []) plt.imshow(inputs[i].numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0)) ax.set_title(labels.numpy()[i]) break . . . This looks much better! Comparing the retina images to the ones before the preprocessing, we can see that the apparent discrepancies between the photographs are now fixed. The eyes now have a similar circular shape and the color scheme is more consistent. This should help the model to detect the signs of the DR on the photographs. . Check out this notebook by Nakhon Ratchasima for more ideas on the image preprocessing for retina photographs. The preprocessing functions used in this project are largely inspired by his work suring the competition. .",

            "title": "Algorithmic Fairness in R",
            "content": "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; . Tutorial on the fairness R package . How to measure fairness of a machine learning model? . To date, a number of algorithmic fairness metrics have been proposed. Demographic parity, proportional parity, equalized odds and predictive rate parity are the most commonly used metrics to evaluate fairness between sensitive groups in binary classification problems. Multiple other metrics have been proposed that use various metrics from the confusion matrix (e.g., false positive rate parity, false negative rate parity). . The fairness R package provides tools to easily calculate algorithmic fairness metrics for given predicted probabilities or predicted classes between different sensitive groups. It also provides opportunities to visualize and compare other prediction metrics between the subgroups. . Disclaimer! None of the implemented metrics are supposed to replace critical thinking about the problem in question. . Installation . You can instal the latest stable package version from CRAN by running: . install.packages(&#39;fairness&#39;) library(fairness) . You may also install the development version from Github: . library(devtools)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; devtools::install_github(&#39;kozodoi/fairness&#39;) library(fairness) . &lt;/div&gt; Data description . This package includes two data sets to study algorithmic fairness: compas and germancredit. In this tutorial, you will be able to use a simplified version of the landmark COMPAS data set containing containing criminal history of defendants from Broward County. You can read more about the data set here. To load the data set, all you need to do is: . data(&#39;compas&#39;) . The compas data set contains nine variables. The outcome variable is Two_yr_Recidivism, which is a binary indicator showing whether an individual commited a crime in the two-year period. The data also includes features on prior criminal record (Number_of_Priors and Misdemeanor) and other features describing age (Age_Above_FourtyFive and Age_Below_TwentyFive), sex (Female) and ethnicity (ethnicity). . You don’t really need to delve into the data much. To simplify illustration, we have already ran a prediction model that uses all features to predict Two_yr_Recidivism and concatenated the predicted probabilities (probability) and predicted classes (predicted) to the data. You will be able to use the probability and predicted columns directly in your analysis. Please feel free to set up other prediction models (e.g. excluding sensitive group information, such as sex and ethnicity) and use your generated predicted probabilities or classes to assess group fairness. . The second data set included in the package is a credit scoring data set labeled as germancredit. The data set includes 20 potential predictor features describing yhe loan applicants and an outcome variables named BAD, which is a binary indicator showing whether the applicant defaulted on a loan. Similarly to the compas data set, this data also includes two pre-made columns with model predictions named probability and predicted. Feel free to play wit this data as well! You can load it with: . data(&#39;germancredit&#39;) . Algorithmic group fairness metrics . The package currently includes nine fairness metrics and two other comparisons implemented. Many of these metrics are mutually exclusive: results from a given classification problem most often cannot be fair in terms of all evaluated group fairness metrics. Below, all these functions will be introduced in detail. For the sake of simplicity, we will use predicted probabilities for all these functions instead of predicted classes. Note that for all functions, in case of defining predicted probabilities, a cutoff needs to be defined in order to generate positive (1) or negative (0) predicted classes. Also, for all functions, a base group needs to be defined. All other groups will be compared to this base group in terms of fairness metrics. . An outlook on the confusion matrix . Most fairness metrics use various measures calculated from the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is comprised of four distinct classes: . True positives (TP): True class positive and predicted positive (correct classification) | False positives (FP): True class negative and predicted positive (incorrect classification) | True negatives (TN): True class negative and predicted negative (correct classification) | False negatives (FN): True class positive and predicted negative (incorrect classification) | All fairness metrics are calculated using one or more of these measures. For a detailed overview of various measures and precise definitions, please click here, here or here. . Demographic parity . Demographic parity is achieved if the absolute number of positive predictions in the subgroups are close to each other. This measure does not take true class into consideration, only positive predictions. Formula: (TP + FP) . dem_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;Caucasian&#39;) . Proportional parity . Proportional parity is very similar to Demographic parity. Proportional parity is achieved if the proportion of positive predictions in the subgroups are close to each other. This measure does not take true class into consideration, only positive predictions. Formula: (TP + FP) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) . prop_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;Caucasian&#39;) . All the rest of the functions take the true class into consideration. . Equalized odds . Equalized odds are achieved if the sensitivities (true positives divided by all positives) in the subgroups are close to each other. Formula: TP / (TP + FN) . equal_odds(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Predictive rate parity . Predictive rate parity is achieved if the precisions or positive predictive values (true positives divided by all predicted positive) in the subgroups are close to each other. Formula: TP / (TP + FP) . pred_rate_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Accuracy parity . Accuracy parity is achieved if the accuracies (all accurately classified divided by all predictions) in the subgroups are close to each other. Formula: (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) . acc_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . False negative rate parity . False negative rate parity is achieved if the false negative rates (division of false negatives with all positives) in the subgroups are close to each other. Formula: FN / (TP + FN) . fnr_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . False positive rate parity . False positive rate parity is achieved if the false positive rates (division of false positives with all negatives) in the subgroups are close to each other. Formula: FP / (TN + FP) . fpr_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Negative predictive value parity . Negative predictive value parity is achieved if the negative predictive values (division of true negatives with all predicted negatives) in the subgroups are close to each other. This function can be considered the ‘inverse’ of Predictive rate parity. Formula: TN / (TN + FN) . npv_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Specificity parity . Specificity parity is achieved if the specificities (division of true negatives with all negatives) in the subgroups are close to each other. This function can be considered the ‘inverse’ of Equalized odds. Formula: TN / (TN + FP) . spec_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Two additional comparisons are implemented, namely ROC AUC and Matthews correlation coefficient comparisons. . ROC AUC comparison . This function calculates ROC AUC and visualizes ROC curves for all subgroups. Note that probabilities must be defined for this function. Also, as ROC evaluates all possible cutoffs, the cutoff argument is excluded from this function. . roc_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Matthews correlation coefficient comparison . The Matthews correlation coefficient takes all 4 classes of the confusion matrix into consideration. According to some, it is the single most powerful metric in binary classification problems, especially for data with class imbalances. Formula: (TP×TN-FP×FN)/√((TP+FP)×(TP+FN)×(TN+FP)×(TN+FN)) . mcc_parity(data = compas, outcome = &#39;Two_yr_Recidivism&#39;, group = &#39;ethnicity&#39;, probs = &#39;probability&#39;, preds_levels = c(&#39;no&#39;,&#39;yes&#39;), cutoff = 0.5, base = &#39;African_American&#39;) . Output and visualizations . All functions output results and matching barcharts that provide visual cues about the parity metrics for the defined sensitive subgroups. For instance, let’s look at predictive rate parity with ethnicity being set as the sensitive group and considering Caucasians as the ‘base’ group: . output$Metric #&gt; Caucasian African_American Asian Hispanic #&gt; Precision 0.6967156 0.6828704 0.7777778 0.7194444 #&gt; Predictive Rate Parity 1.0000000 0.9801279 1.1163490 1.0326229 #&gt; Native_American Other #&gt; Precision 0.6666667 0.7209302 #&gt; Predictive Rate Parity 0.9568706 1.0347554 . In the upper row, the raw precision values are shown for all ethnicities, and in the row below, the relative precisions compared to Caucasians (1) are shown. Note that in case an other ethnic group is set as the base group (e.g. Hispanic), the raw precision values do not change, only the relative metrics: . output$Metric #&gt; Hispanic Caucasian African_American Asian #&gt; Precision 0.7194444 0.6967156 0.6828704 0.7777778 #&gt; Predictive Rate Parity 1.0000000 0.9684078 0.9491634 1.0810811 #&gt; Native_American Other #&gt; Precision 0.6666667 0.7209302 #&gt; Predictive Rate Parity 0.9266409 1.0020652 . A standard output is a barchart that shows the relative metrics for all subgroups. For the previous case (when Hispanic is defined as the base group), this plot would look like this: . output$Metric_plot . . When probabilities are defined, an extra density plot will be output with the distributions of probabilities of all subgroups and the user-defined cutoff: . output$Probability_plot . . Another example would be comparing males vs. females in terms of recidivism prediction and defining a 0.4 cutoff: . output$Probability_plot . . The function related to ROC AUC comparisons will output ROC curves for each subgroups. Let’s look at the plot, also comparing males vs. females: . output$ROCAUC_plot . . Closing words . You have read through the fairness R package tutorial and by now, you have a solid grip on algorithmic group fairness metrics.
